# My DreamNews APP :cookie:

**YouTube video with app functionality: https://youtu.be/AECh1xpZNzE**

This is a simple News app with MVVM architecture. There are no Jetpack Compose and other cool staff. 

It contains all the basic functionality that each and every news app should have. So you can search all breaking news, filter them by clicking the buttons above.
Then you can click to any news and add it to the saved news, if you want to delete it you can swipe it or click once more to a save button. You can search news by writing your request in a search fragment.

_**This app was translated to english and russian languages :white_check_mark:**_

**_Some news from google news source do not open in Russia but in other countries works fine._**
